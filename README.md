UVA Data Scientist | GitHub Portfolio

## Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

Hey there! I'm a passionate data enthusiast embarking on a journey to become a proficient data scientist. Welcome to my UVA GitHub repository, where I document my learning process, showcase my projects, and share my insights.

### About Me

I began my journey in software design and architecture, developing fluency in languages like JavaScript, Fortran, and C. Over time, I pivoted into the life sciences to bridge manual research with computational tooling—engineering systems that automated redundant workflows, diversified experimental design, and accelerated innovation in biomaterials, pre-clinical drug discovery, and plant-based nutrition. With that chapter complete, I now return to the computational domain, rebuilding and sharpening my foundation in machine learning systems. Much has changed since TensorFlow 1.15, and I’m eager to engage with today’s data science challenges with a hybrid perspective grounded in both code and deep-tech experimentation.

### What You'll Find Here

**Projects**: I'm constantly working on diverse data science projects to sharpen my skills and explore different aspects of the field. From exploratory data analysis to machine learning models, you'll find a variety of projects that demonstrate my learning progress and interests.

**Code Snippets**: As I tackle various challenges and learn new techniques, I share useful code snippets and scripts that I find helpful. Feel free to explore and use them in your own projects!

**Learning Resources**: I believe in the importance of continuous learning, so I often share resources such as articles, tutorials, and courses that have been instrumental in my learning journey. Whether you're a fellow data enthusiast or someone looking to delve into data science, you might find these resources valuable.

### Get in Touch

I'm always open to collaboration, feedback, and connecting with like-minded individuals. Whether you have a project idea, want to discuss a data-related topic, or simply want to say hello, feel free to reach out to me via email [dsmloptechnician at google url].

Thank you for stopping by, and I hope you find my GitHub repository informative and inspiring. Let's learn and grow together in the fascinating world of data science!

Happy exploring!

IYKYK... Yes, I do maintain several private repositories; however, they involve proprietary technologies and are subject to non-disclosure agreements, so I’m unable to share them publicly.
